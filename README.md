# Ã©tudes

Practicing programming in public.

This monorepo contains the following projects:

- `aoc/` - advent of code challenges.
- `leetcode/` - interview programming puzzles.
- `mnist/` - MNIST digit classifiers implemented in various languages.
- `sicp/` - exercise solutions for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Note that this repo will always be messy and incomplete. I'm treating it more as a public scratchpad than as a project that can be completed.

Prior art: [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), [etudes for programmers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1096892).
