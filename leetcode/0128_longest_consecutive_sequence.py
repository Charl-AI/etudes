"""Longest consecutive sequence.

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# O(n) time, O(n) space. Trick is to convert to set, then use the fact
# that sequences can only start on values where num-1 is not in the set.
